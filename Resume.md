<p style="margin:0;display:inline;float:left">Master of IT: Data Science </p>
<p style="margin:0;display:inline;float:right" >Expected Sep 2021</p>

<br>
- **Thesis**:   Semantic Representation Of Human Behaviours Using Numerical Vectors
- Built 5 neural network architectures for making behaviour vectors
- System for deriving a numerical vector for player behavior in games, 
  using Energy Based Models. Empirical analysis on how behavior vectors
  enable better player style recognition and game fine-tuning for individual player styles.

The Notes Project
- Published all my 50+ detailed Machine Learning notes on GitHub
- Topics Covered: Encoder-Decoder and Attention Models, Transformers and BERT, YOLO V3,
  Image Segmentation using UNets, Semantic Search using Elastic Stack, Spark & MLLib,
  Foundations of Supervised, Unsupervised models, Deep Learning models, Foundations of Statistics,
  Probability, Linear Algebra, ML Interview Questions, etc.
  
Hand Gesture Recognition
- Trained MobileNet to classify 25 unique hand gestures solely using webcam feed
- Achieved 20x boost in live classification speed compared to InceptionV3
- 30 FPS live classification, without GPU, on dual core laptop
- Utilized: Keras, OpenCV for capturing webcam feed, PyAutoGUI for creating keystrokes and mouse events

Self-Driving Car Vision Module
- Trained InceptionV3 to predict steering angle based on dash cam footage in real time
- Used 25 minutes of dash cam footage from a real car to train the CNN
- Utilized: Keras, OpenCV, Transfer Learning using InceptionV3 CNN, GCP for training/testing models

Search Engine
- Distributed and scalable clone of Google
- This is a big and upcoming project. I'll write several blog posts describing my journey
