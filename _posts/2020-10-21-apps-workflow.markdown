1. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Notability</span> - It’s an iPad app designed for taking and organizing hand-written notes. It syncs between my iPad, iPhone, and Mac. So I have access to my notes at all times. It also allows searching the handwriting, which is occasionally useful.

2. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">TickTick</span> - It’s a calendar and to-do list combined. I can plan out my entire week in advance and it will remind me of meetings 5-10 minutes before they start. If you ask me whether I’m free and 7 pm 15 days from now, I’ll have a clear answer. Google Calendar is free and has better integrations but I liked the UX of this app better. 

3. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Money Manager</span> - All the my transactions are logged into this app. I know where each dollar goes or comes in. Pretty handy to keep track of spending. 

4. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Momentum</span> -  Helps me keep track of each habit. This is the cleanest app I found and liked.

5. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Bear</span>-  I like minimal UI, execution speed and organization with my note taking apps. Bear fits the bill and it’s cheaper than the competition. Evernote, Roam Research and others were too clunky. Notability is only really good for hand-written notes and includes text input features as a formality, which is why Bear comes into the equation as a second note-taking app for everything else. I also want the app to open as fast as possible on my iPhone, for quick note taking. Bear and Google Keep were the only ones that passed the speed test. I kept Bear since it has an app for Mac. So, Notability for handwritten notes and Bear for everything else.

6. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Anki</span> - It’s the official app. I almost never make the cards myself. Anki makes sense if we’re not the ones making the cards. Which is why I only keep pre-made decks or decks I outsourced to someone in India. Some people spend a ton of time making the decks and treasure the process but I like to save time in that process. The decks I have are Machine Learning Interview questions, System Design questions, questions from Elements of Programming Interviews  and more. I scan through a couple of cards every time I’m aimlessly browsing the phone.

7. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">PocketCasts</span> - Their UI is clean and functional. I used this for my subscribed podcasts. I use this one all the time when cooking, doing workouts, taking walks or completing chores.

8. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Apple Podcasts</span> - I use this one for the discovery of new podcasts. Often times I might be thinking of some topic and need to hear some expert opinion on that topic. So I search for the topic on this app, download a dozen episodes and listen to them. This app is good for the task because it allows searching individual episodes and also search inside the transcripts of the podcasts. 

9. <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Bound</span> - It’s an audiobook player with minimal UI. I also have audible but I only use it for books exclusive to audible.

Minimal and clean UI played an important role in the choices I’ve made. Most of them are iOS only apps sadly. I like to rely on technology to reduce my workload and leverage the fact that we’re in the 21st century. Using a combination all these apps truly helps me simplify my workflow and allows me to shift my focus on more important ideas.

I’m also planning to include Trello in here when I finally start using that. Roam Research is absent from here because I’m planning to transfer all those notes to Bear now. I’m a bit uncomfortable with the lack of organization in Roam. I hope the list helped you discover something great for your workflow.
