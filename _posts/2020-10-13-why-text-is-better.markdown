Alright, this is not the case at all times. Sometimes it's better to listen or watch a video. Like when I'm cooking dinner or working out. This discussion is only for learning technical content as a Software Engineer. Here are some reasons why I found books to be better for most of my technical learning goals:

1) It's easier to find books
===
Making a video course not only involves writing the script but also recording it and editing it. This is a big barrier and the video delivery can be hit or miss. It's hard to find video courses or YouTube videos for a topic because it's hard to make one. Since there's so much effort involved, we get fewer creators and finished products. Also, books have been around for much longer than online video courses.

When learning anything I always try to find that "perfect" online course that would teach me all but it rarely ends up working. Recently I've been finding great books on OReilly's portal. 

2) Books can be skimmed
===
The only way of skipping a video is jumping to some future timestamp hoping I didn't miss anything. Or I have speed it up, which makes it difficult to hear and spoils the experience. With books, it's easier to skim through the content faster and only look at the important bits. Not all content is useful, so skipping is quite helpful to save time. Of course, there are some books require contemplation but those are rare. I realized this recently, and have started to take advantage of the fact.

3) Less bandwidth
===
It's easier to take books offline, most of the apps provide that option. This used to be a bigger issue back in India where data was slow and scarce.

4) Easy note-taking with books
===
Take a look this, this can't be done in a video where we're forced to make notes from scratch.

Even without the iPad, it's easier to highlight and underline sentences in books, while in videos we rely on the creator to provide notes or we have to make them from scratch.

When Video/Audio Content is Better
===

Sometimes when I'm too tired to read anything actively, when I'm working out, making dinner or taking a walking, video/audio content is my go to source of learning. I'm not a purist, so I'll take whatever is favorable for the situation. There's a time to use everything, and in times like these, passive content consumption wins.

Concluding Thoughts
===

These thoughts come from a recent realization I had and your situation might demand a different strategy. Choose whatever suits your learning style better. Efficiency of something doesn't matter as much as our willingness to use that thing. These sources provide the best return on time invested in reading:

- [Educative.io] - Their entire website is based on text based courses and giving users the ability ot skim through the content. The courses are usually concise, high quality and with some practical exposure using their built-in exercises.

- [O'Reilly] - I have access to them using my university library and I couldn't recommend them more. The books are usually no BS, high quality material. Anyone who's serious about learning a subject will appreciate their material.
