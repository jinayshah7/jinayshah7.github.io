Being in a third tier college in India 1 year ago, I never imagined having any real
chances of getting into Google. Even after getting into one of the top engineering
universities in Canada, I never tried applying to Google knowing that they'd just reject me outright.
 It was always a dream for me, nothing more.
 
Things have changed now. After spending significant time on online forums like Reddit, Quora, etc,
I think I know what's required to get in. I have a small income from my jobs too, which can help buy the
resources needed for preparation. Here's my plan for making Project Google a reality:


Data Structures and Algorithms
===
- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Interview Prep Course</span> - I've used this video course for the going through the foundations of basic data structures and algorithms. The explanations are simple and thorough enough for understanding the concept deeply. Despite that I decided to not invest much time in this course since it is video based. For me, I find it easier and faster to go through text based courses or some book. I do like watching videos but that's only when I'm working out, cooking or doing some other chores. 

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Cracking The Coding Interview (Medium)</span> - The real value of this book is not the difficulty of the questions like EPI but in the context that this book provides. The book provides tons of explanations to go with each problem along with alternative approaches. This is helpful when one is just starting out with the interview prep process.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Elements of Programming Interviews (Medium - Hard)</span> - The book has significantly harder problems compared to other source out there. I've chosen the Python edition which takes advantage of the inbuilt libraries to present the simplest solution possible. There are times when I think they sacrifice readability for conciseness but that's an okay sacrifice for getting the other good parts in the book.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline"> Grokking the Coding Interview</span> - The course is text based and focusses on presenting patterns like sliding windows, binary search variations, two pointers, DFS, BFS, etc. Being aware of the patterns and solving a few of those questions is equivalent ot solving a ton of questions and seeing patterns after that. In my opinion, this course was a great confidence booster for me. Some of the solutions have minimal explanations which might be a problem for beginners. This course is targeted towards people who are clear on their foundations.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline"> Grokking the Dynamic Programming Interview</span> - It's similar to the previous course but this time they focus on DP patterns.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline"> LeetCode Premium </span> - They have collection of questions asked in interviews and we have the ability to filter them based frequency, and company name. I think this is super helpful, and well worth the money. Many people might have different opinion about spending money here, but I believe it does provide value. 

Mock Interviews
===
- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">interviewing.io</span> - Allows having real interviews with engineers from specific FAANG companies. The interview can be of the type DS-Algo or System Design, real interview setting or a mentoring session. The interviews are pretty costly, ranging from 100-225 USD, but that doesn't bother me. It's an investment, not an expense. 

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Pramp</span> - This one provides free interviews with peers like us, and it's free. I'm planning to one interview a day in Nov 2020, and 2-3 interviews a day in Dec 2020.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Gainlo & ExpertMitra </span>- Both are pretty affordable compared to interviewing.io but the quality needs to be confirmed. I'll write a review after trying them.

Flashcards
===
I plan to memorize the high level solutions for a ton of problems, so new problems are easily mappable to the ones we know. The more dots we have, the easier it is to connect them. Making the flashcards will not take time, I'll outsource that work to someone on UpWork. These are the resources for which I'm going to make flashcards:

- Elements of Programming Interviews
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- Grokking the Coding Interview

Here's how I structure my cards:
- Front
    - The screenshot of the whole question
- Back
    - TL;DR of the solution - This can be a short 2 line description from my side like "use XOR to add the numbers". The goal of this effort is to remember this part.
    - The entire solution - Sometimes I might forget what the TLDR means, so the second part needs to have enough information to let me re-learn the whole solution 
    

Behavioural Questions
===
I'm planning to make a deck with all possible questions based on my resume, and start rehearsing them. I'm pretty sure the nervousness of going to a Google interview will make me sound more natural! I'm also going through the tips in this course:

- Grokking The Behavioural Interview
