I don’t have the data to back this up. This is my personal opinion, so I’m not trying to convince you to leave ML. I’m just trying to lay out the thought process behind my decision. Here are some things I observed:


### Companies Don’t Need a Ton of DS/MLEs anyway
Due to the nature of the job, only a small number of ML/DS teams can deliver their full potential impact to the business. Like all other jobs, ML/DS works best when there’s a specific ratio of people working on it. That ratio is low, in my opinion.


And you might tell me, “Jinay, what about companies who use ML as their main business model? Aren’t they all MLE/DS? Isn’t that a high ratio?”


For every company that uses ML, there are several other companies whose teams have no MLEs. That brings us back to where we were; there aren’t many job postings for MLE/DS. There’s an absence of demand and oversupply of engineers who want to do great projects. The potential applications might be great, but I don’t want to be in such an imbalanced industry.


### DS/MLE Job requirements Are Turning Into Software Engineering job requirements


I guess that the whole field is going to merge into software engineering slowly. Instead of hiring an MLE, the company would rather train their SWEs to work with ML. 


Specialized MLEs are good at tuning models and making them work. The important thing is, ML isn’t about tuning models anymore. The MLEs who do have a serious job are training the models and serving them through APIs. A regular MLE is more focused on trying to glue different tools together and make an application work. 


### Hand Wavy Development and Too Much Math


Imagine connecting many neurons in a fancy way, tweaking hyper-parameters together and watching the model train hoping to god it’ll turn out good. Imagine doing this all day. That might be a fine job for some, but I’m not too fond of the uncertainty here. I’ve realized I’m more interested in building tangible things that I know will work, like the search engine I’m building. There’s no “hoping to god” to make it work; it’s all about managing the parts right. 


A lot of ML development is empirical, practical and based on trial-error. “Someone in some research said this work; let’s TRY it.” It feels like magic, and we’re not in control of the outcomes. 


The research papers are too math-heavy and hard to follow. I’m concerned about this because I have to read and understand these papers routinely as an MLE. I don’t feel enticed by this type of workflow. 


### I don’t want to pigeonhole myself in one industry this early in my career


My philosophy is to have a T shaped skillset—Jack of all trades and master of one. I think switching from SWE->MLE is easier than the other way around. It is the beginning of my career, so I would prefer staying a generalist SWE right now, maintaining a broad skill set I can always come back when the MLE market is more stable.


### What does it mean for me?


Both jobs have about the same pay, but it’s five times harder to get an MLE job vs SWE. You do the math. Apart from that, the interviews for SWE are much more defined, and it is possible to prepare for it using online resources.


Having said all that, if someone offered me an MLE job right now for a 100k, I would happily take it. I have my reservations, but money takes precedence. 


**Side-note:** There’s a class of Data Scientists whose job is to be a statistics god, which I’m certainly not. None of this applies to them.
