This is something I observed in the industry, however, I don’t have the data to back this up. It’s my personal opinion.  Here’s the problem I’m going to discuss: The ratio of SWE compared to DS/MLE.

This train of thought started after I saw a tiny number of postings for ML/DS roles compared to general SWE roles. I figured it would be because ML has not matured as an industry yet. The demand will increase with time and we may have more MLE jobs in the market. I do think they’ll increase in an absolute level but I also think SWE is going to take over the role. I think the industry is still maturing, and in the process of phasing out the ML/DS role.

My theory is that companies just need less ML/DS members in the first place due to the nature of the job. A small team of focussed MLE/DS can deliver a solid value and any more headcount would be redundant. This is not true for SWE. I believe that’s the cause of minuscule ML/DS headcount in the industry, not due to lack of development in the industry. Rather than hiring MLEs, companies have started to lean on their SWE staff to pickup ML skills and get the job done. Even the job descriptions for MLE roles have started to look more like software engineering.

In future, ML will just be another smaller subfield of software engineering like mobile, embedded, distributed systems, etc. I see this hype train of ML slowing down in the coming years and settle on a gentle pace. 

### What does it mean for you?

MLE are paid about the same as SWE, but it’s 5 times harder to excel in the field since there’s so much to keep up with and the industry requirements fluctuate every year. SWE pays about the same, the interviews are much more defined and it’s going to be here for a while. I’d say learn it for the sake of fun but don’t jump on the ML bandwagon if your intention is to earn money. 

Side-note - There’s a class of Data Scientists whose job is to solely be a data scientist, the ones who’re stats gods. Those are not the ones I’m talking about, this is more of an industry trend I noticed for DS whose job description includes heavy ML work.

My personal plan is to quit tuning all these neural networks and start build data-intensive applications. ML/DS might be hype I don’t believe in but the data hype is something I strongly believe in.
