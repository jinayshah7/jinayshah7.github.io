My college was a no-name college in the Western part of India. They took up most of the day, from 10 AM to 6 PM. There wasn't much work beyond just attending the mandatory classes. Exams were mostly easy and if they were hard, I didn't care. We had a lot of free time. So like one does, I started reading books. 

In the first three years, I managed to read 170 books. It was a combination of Kindle, physical books, and audiobooks. I did have a social life but I spent most of my free time reading. It was a combination of books being a good source of wisdom and my own hunger for knowledge & exposure to the outer world.

Apart from books, I also liked listening to podcasts and getting new perspectives every day. Most of my podcasts are psychology, finance, economics, fiction, etc. I'll write dedicated posts to mention all the podcasts I listen. For now, my favorite is Planet Money.

It was good times, I learned a lot during these 4 years and my college had nothing to do with it. That's all I wanted to write here.
