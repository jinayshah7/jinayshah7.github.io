This is the honest simplified version of my resume 

<span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Bell</span>
My team manages thousands of firewall devices for business clients and this involves a lot of interaction with those firewalls. Upgrades need to happen, rules need to be updated, etc. These interactions tend to eat up our team member’s times, so there’s some scope for automating tasks. My day to day projects involve working with team members to identify and eliminate pain points which require too much manual work. My projects are usually some Python script communicating with dozens of servers at once, and interacting with them quickly, to save manual labor.

<span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Teaching Assistant</span>
It’s a programming course using C. The professor has lectures and assignments while I manage the labs/practical exposure. A lot of my time goes to office hours where students can join a live stream and ask questions. But I also make videos to explain the practical labs. There’s about 150 students each term so I get to interact with a ton of students each week. 

<span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Research Assistant</span>
This can be a job, but this funding is supposed to help me pay my bills. Occasionally I do work on some tasks to help my supervisor. These are tasks that can be outsourced but would still require the expertise of a Masters student. For example, taking a graduate class, critiquing a research paper, providing feedback on research talks, adding features to a software project, etc. Technically my thesis work can be included under this job.

It’s quite easy to manage them if done smartly. Bell is supposed to be 20 hours a week but I don’t actually take 20 hours to complete my tasks, I complete them in 12-13 hours because I can code fast. TA is supposed to be 10 hours a week, but I can occasionally save one or two hours by working fast. Research Assistant job only occasionally has workload. So I spend at most 20 hours a week on these 3 jobs. There’s no commute in lockdown, so I save about 14 hours a week just commuting.

The rest of my week is spent on thesis research, Project Google, taking long walks and learning piano.
