I haven’t played a game in many years now. That doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy them. It’s quite the opposite. I do wish to play games all day with my friends, have popcorn and maybe watch a movie after we’re done playing. 

If I want it so bad, why don’t I get a good console? It’s because of potential addiction and wastage of a lot of time. Maybe I can limit the time I play it? Only on some days? 

Every extra minute I spend playing a game is not spent on preparing for a job at Google. I know it’s important to have fun, and play a bit. But I’ve found that it’s easier to keep a 100% policy than to keep a 95% policy of playing games. It’s just easier to not play them entirely right now, rather than exerting self control every day.

I do have the time to play them, I just spend that time learning piano, taking long walks and talking with friends. Those activities are much more valuable to me. Hopefully, in the future when I don’t have to solve LeetCode problems everyday, I’ll get a new gaming console, a big TV, and a big couch for all my friends. 

TLDR; I love playing games, I just can’t afford to play them right now because my career would be affected.
