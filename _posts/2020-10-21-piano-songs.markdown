I'm correcting the mistake I made in programming. I didn't build extremely hard projects from the beginning and am now regretting that decision. With Piano, I wish to correct that by focussing on learning hard songs for my level. Theory is good but practicing and pushing my limits has been more fruitful at this stage. It's taking an average 1-2 months to learn each song. Learning has been necoming easier but so has been the difficulty of songs I choose to learn. So it takes about the same time.
