Why go to another country? 
I got out of India looking for a better life and opportunities. The money I earn in Canada will help me reach my financial goals, stay secure, and give my parents a good life. The people who tell me," Go back to your own country," have no idea how privileged they are and what it feels like being left out of opportunities just because you're born in the wrong place.

Just because I'm born in the wrong place/ with the wrong colour doesn't mean I shouldn't get the opportunities you're getting. I'm just looking for a better life. These points are relevant to a student immigrant.

### Immigration Timeline in Canada
- Year 2 - Finish Masters degree and join a full-time job
- Year 3 - Apply for Permanent Residency (PR)
- Year 5 - Apply for citizenship
- Year 6 onwards - Continue a job, start a business, or take a year-long road trip; you're now allowed to stay in Canada no matter what. Enjoy travelling with a Canadian passport.

### Immigration Timeline in the USA
- Year 2 - Finish Masters degree and find a job in 3 months or go home
- Year 3,4,5 - Apply for an H1B visa and hopefully get in line for a PR (Green Card)
- Year 5-20:
   -  Keep working at the same company, in the same role.
   - Can't stay unemployed for more than 60 days.
   - Pay tax but have no representation or rights.
   - Always live in fear of being deported or a change in the immigration rules. 
   - No businesses or startups, thank you very much.
   - Capital gains shouldn't exceed 20% of primary job income. Bye bye real estate, stocks, etc. 
   - Wife can't work legally.
   - Travel with an Indian passport.
- Year 20 onwards - Wait for the government's mercy and Green Card
- Someday in the future - Get PR, get US citizenship and get stuck with their citizenship-based tax system, congratulations!

### The Problem of Extra Income Sources
If you only care about earning through your main job, this section might not appeal to you. That is relevant for those who're interested in diversifying income sources through investments.

#### During the Master's Degree
I'm allowed to work unlimited hours on campus and 20 hours/week outside the campus. During the vacation days, I'm allowed to work 40 hours/week. I've seen some do 60 hours/week in the vacations. For example, right now, I'm working 20 hours/week for Bell and another two jobs (RA & TA) on campus. That is, however, not allowed in the US. Students are only allowed to work 20 hours ON CAMPUS. Good luck finding jobs.

#### After Finishing Masters Degree
After getting a work permit in Canada, I'm allowed to have other capital gains.  Three years into the timeline, I'm already getting a PR, can register an LLC or LP and have any other income sources. At this point, I can expand my options trading, invest in real estate, flip a house, or buy/start a business.

That is not true for an immigrant in the USA. The salary from their employer should be the only primary source of income. However, buy and hold is allowed because they don't realize the gains until the asset is sold. I think not being able to freely trade is a major limitation and causes huge opportunity costs.

### What We All Live Forâ€¦ Peace Of Mind

As a Canadian resident, I can change to whatever jobs or roles I want without consequences. Thus I'm now more likely to get higher compensation and career growth by changing companies. It's not about money; it's also about getting multiple exposures to the industry by being indifferent teams. After year 3, I'm a Permanent Resident, so I don't have to wake up every day with the fear of being sent back. Money cannot possible match this peace of mind. Freedom is the best source of happiness, in my opinion. That is not the case for someone in the US; here's why:

#### Getting Stuck Due To H1B
Changing companies is super hard on the H1B; it can take months in some cases. Sometimes, while changing companies, candidates have to start their 20 year-long Green Card process from scratch. Staying at one company for 10-15 years is the best way to get a low salary, lesser industry connections, lesser career growth and less exposure in general. H1B people can't quit easily, and companies take advantage of this. I've seen Reddit/Quora posts mentioning how Fortune 500 companies exploit the situation. Please do more research about this; it's rampant.

#### Changing Government Rules
The person in the US is living on a temporary visa and at the mercy of the government. One executive order can change someone's fate and send them back home. I know all my connections in the US have to live in constant fear of being deported, stopped at the airport or fear changes in  visa policies.

### Where is the USA Better Than Canada?
Salary and opportunities. Salaries are double in the USA compared to Canada; there's not much I can explain here. For opportunities, I see most of the USA's good ones and only a handful of top companies having offices in Canada. 

When we think of getting a job in Canada, the only two realistic options are Toronto and Vancouver. In the US, there's a much better diversity of companies, cities and climates. The USA is objectively better here. 

### TN Visa Route - Best Of Both Worlds?
At year 5, I'll get the Canadian Passport and have an option to work in the US. Canadians get the TN Visa for working in the USA, and they can renew it indefinitely. The visa isn't capped and is super easy to get. Switching companies is super easy on this TN visa, so no one will pressure you to stay 15 years at one company. It's like the best of both worlds; you have the US's salary but the security of being a Canadian citizen. I'll stick to Canada in future for my reasons, but it's good to have options.
