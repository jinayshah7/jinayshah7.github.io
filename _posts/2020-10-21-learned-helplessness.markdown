It was 2015, I had finished my high school and we were looking for good colleges in the state. The most important factor was finding a job after graduation. So we looked at the typical new grad salaries for the colleges we considered, it was around $3500 a year if the student put in decent effort. Some would work harder and earn $7k if they’re lucky but $3k-$5k was the norm for students with decent grades.

Throughout the years of my bachelors, I believed that was the salary I would get if I worked hard enough. The companies that visited the college campus were rather big but mainly consulting sweatshops who had high employee turnover. Working 2 years at those type of companies was considered a part of the journey.  If it’s so hard to get into a consulting shop, I couldn't imagine how hard it would be to get into top companies like Google or Facebook.  No recruiter was going to invite me and neither did I have the technical skills needed to survive the interview process. Hell, I didn't even have laptop for half of my IT degree. I knew I had the potential to get in, but it often takes more than potential or hard work to get success. Platform, guidance, privilege and network matters a lot. There was no way in for me, I accepted the fact and moved on. How is a person like ME getting any chances at Google?!

Fast forward to Sep 2019, I joined one of the top engineering universities in Canada with a decent scholarship. A month into the degree, my friend Emma and I were having a chat about applying to summer internships. She mentioned she had already applied to Facebook, Google and a couple other companies for Summer 2020 internships. She had a bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto, one of the top universities in the world. If someone had fair chances of getting in, it was going to be her. 

“Why don’t you apply too?”, she asked me.

“I know they’re going to reject me, and most probably even before getting to the interview. Even if they give me an interview, I’m not good enough to clear them”

“Hmm. But you should still apply, right?”

“Yeah, maybe. Google is probably out of my league and the best I’ll do is get a phone screen and fail miserably.”

I checked out their website later that day and found out it was already too late to apply. “Next time!”, I thought. I had a similar conversation with one of my professors who previously worked at Google. 

Being in a helpless situation in India, I learned to cope up with it. At the time, it kept me safe from feeling miserable about my career and potential. I accepted the fact that I couldn't make it to Google and kept believing that even though my chances had slightly improved.

Sometimes, we’re in bad situations and it’s not possible to achieve certain things. We make assumptions about what we can do or cannot do based on the situation. And we keep holding on to these assumptions even if the situation improves. This is called learned helplessness.

Learned helplessness exists in everyone’s life in one way or the other, and part of everyone’s psyche. I think there's no way to solve this problem but we can just be a little more aware of it, and perhaps revisit the assumptions we have about our potential. 

PS - Emma has a different name in real life.
