I come from a computer science background but when it comes to understanding big systems, I'm nearly clueless about their inner functioning. Despite my knowledge of building complicated neural networks, it's quite difficult or rather impossible for me to build an entire Machine Learning pipeline. Reading these books is an attempt to address the gaps in my knowledge of distributed system design. The list will keep on changing as I read some of these books or decide to read something else. Since I haven't read these books, all the descriptions will include why I think it'll benefit me, not how the book actually is. I'm expecting most of these books to come in useful for building the search engine later on.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Designing Data Intensive Applications </span> - The book keeps turning up in all conversations online. And I found that there's a wealth of pre-made notes on this book, which I can leverage for flashcards or revision. 

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Head First Design Patterns </span> - I keep using a lot of patterns at my work but wanted a formal approach to all the patterns. I'm just going to use this book for understanding but I'm pretty sure there will be other notes available for making flashcards. As always, I'm going to outsource the flashcard making to UpWork. 

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Kubernetes: Up And Running, 2nd Edition</span> - This is prevalent everywhere and is going to be around for a while, so it's wise to learn it well. I also plan to use it for my search engine later on.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Building Microservices, 2nd Edition</span> - There were other books on this topic but this one is a pre-release so the content will be more relevant to the industry trends.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Designing Distributed Systems</span> - A more foundational or abstract version of the microservices and data-intensive book. Since everything nowadays is much more than a 3 tier system, I'm going to put my best foot forward for learning all the foundations.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Kafka: The Definitive Guide</span> - This one is a pretty significant component of all data engineering systems. It's like duct tape in my opinion, having a ton of applications which are still being explored in the industry. Even if I don't use this anywhere in my search engine project (highly unlikely), knowing the right applications of this will be great to know.

- <span style="font-weight: 500; display: inline">Hands-on Software Engineering With Go</span> - This book explains Go using a large complex project, a distributed search engine. The book starts with an assumption that the reader is familiar with Go and each chapter builds up on the project. The end goal is to have a distributed search engine deployed on Kubernetes, PageRank implemented for ranking, metrics collection in Prometheus and a lot more. This sounds like a perfect case study for micro-services and modern software engineering. I wish one of my university classes were like this!



Right now I'm busy doing LeetCode and my thesis, but I intend to start reading these books in Jan 2021. Meanwhile, I listen to podcasts that discuss Kubernetes, the data-intensive book, data engineering and other micro-services related topics. That should be a good primer for the actual books in Jan 2021.
