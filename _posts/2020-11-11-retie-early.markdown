I’m retiring on Sept 2, 2027. I was tired of saying “someday” and ended up choosing this date as the deadline, randomly. I’ll be retiring during my highest earning years, so it’ll be a hard decision to make.  But there are far more interesting things to do in life than work in an office all day. I’m planning to go full throttle on music, books and workout. 

When our investments give back enough money to pay our expenses, that’s called financial independence. That’s when someone is free to stop working and retire. Skipping a lot of unnecessary explanations about how to do it, you just need to save about 25-30 times what you spend in a year.  I think saving that much should be easy due to my habits of not eating out and less expensive hobbies (books, music, workout).

Just a warning, this is not a layman’s dream. I trade options for income right now, have knowledge about fundamental/technical stock analysis, and am learning about real estate investing right now. I’m also working hard for securing a high paying job and saving a high percentage of my salary. This is not a dream, it’s a plan. I just put it here simply for keeping the post lucid and short. 

A lot of the details are yet to be decided but the over-arching plan is fixed. I’ll work hard to make this happen. It’s not like I’ll stop working all together, it’ll just be more satisfying activities. I have a bucket list to check off.
