This perspective is for an international student applying to universities in Canada. You’ll usually get into a university that’s a couple notches lower than a local student with the same resume, a couple of notches than what you’d get in the USA. I had a below average resume while applying but still got into a decent university because of circumstances. This was my profile back then:

- 8 IELTS
- 8 CGPA
- 7 small projects in Machine Learning
- YouTube channel for Machine Learning tutorials

I applied to these places:

- Carleton CS - Reject
- Concordia CS - Reject
- Trent Big Data - Reject
- Memorial CE - Reject
- Lakehead CS - ::Accepted::
- Carleton IT - ::Accepted::

I’m perfectly happy with where I am right now but here are some mistakes I think I made:

- Not Applying to 15 Places - Admissions are so unpredictable that it makes sense to cast a wide net. 
- Bad Resume - I had a fancy designer resume which doesn’t work well with parsing algorithms. I think a plain resume like I have on this blog would have been better. Also, people don’t want to spend time looking for information in our resume, it’s better to present it in widely accepted format. 
- Bad SOP - In retrospect, I think the SOP could have been a lot more than just an expanded version of the resume. It’s a place to describe my thoughts and ideas, but didn’t realize it earlier.
- Not Applying Earlier - I started applying too late and missed a ton of other application deadlines which is part of the reason I couldn’t apply to 15 places

The IT department at Carleton requires the student to have a supervisor before admission. I sent some emails to professors in the Carleton IT department, having minimal hope of getting any reply. Thankfully, my current supervisor replied back with an invitation to interview. We had a conversation discussing my projects and about our research interests. 

Right now, I’m doing research under the supervision of Dr. David Thue. The admission process was pretty different than what it normally is in other universities/departments. Universities tend to focus on grades too much, but I had a personal interview which may have changed things in my favour.

The name of the university doesn’t matter as much as having a coop does, I’ll explain that in another post. It’s a long explanation.
