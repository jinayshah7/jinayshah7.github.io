I’ve been learning and trading options since a couple of years now. It was virtual back when I didn’t have the money to do it. Now, I have some savings enough to do small trades. This post is meant to explain the essence of what’s happening in each trades I make. 

Imagine you have a stock worth $100 and you’re not sure if it’ll stay at that price for long. Maybe you’re fearing there will be a crash or maybe the company is expected to go through rough times. You want to be be assured that your stock stays safe and you’ll get your money back. You’re okay with losing $10, but you expect to recover at least $90 from your stock if situation turns bad.

This is where I come and place an offer for you. I’ll take $2 and promise to buy your stock at $90, when you want to sell it. I’ll buy your stock at $90 even if it goes down to $10 or $0. However, you’re only paying me $2, this deal only stays valid for one month. This is a fair exchange, I get $2 and you get security that your stock is safe from market crashes. 

A month has passed and the stock has been performing well, staying above $100. The deal has now expired and you’ll need to buy a new deal from me. This is how I make money. I make deals to buy stocks in case something goes wrong and I get some small premium for taking that risk. Most of the time, nothing happens to the stock and I pocket the commission. 

This is similar to how insurance companies make money. These deal are called options. In our case, I sold you a call option with a strike price of $90 and premium of $2. The more risky the stock, the more it costs to insure it. 

In real markets, options are available at any strike price and it’s cheaper to insure at a lower price. The validity of the option contracts can range from one day to 2-3 years. The longer the validity, the more expensive it is to insure a stock. 

I do this at scale, and it’s a lot more complex than it looks here. But I hope this gives you a better idea of how I get some pocket money trading options! As I said, this is not magic lottery or some hidden secret, it’s cold hard statistics as you dig deeper. Options are the fastest way to loose money, please proceed at your own risk.
