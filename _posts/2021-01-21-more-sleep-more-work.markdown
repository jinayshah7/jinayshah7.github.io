### The Problem

I have a lot going on in life: Master's thesis, SWE Internship, Teaching Assistantship, Piano and Guitar classes. I also cook a healthy meal two times a day and do a one-hour workout. I'm also trying to do online courses and solving algorithms every day for interviews. That's a lot to take in. When I began doing all this together in September, I noticed my performance consistently going down in each task. By November, I was severely burned out and waiting desperately for a Christmas vacation. I thought I didn't have time to complete anything I was doing and struggled a bit during the last two months of 2020. 

It's easy to attribute the burn out to the amount of work I was doing. Maybe I took too much on my plate and didn't have the time to complete it. Maybe doing all of it tired out my mind. The reality was, I had all the time in the world to keep up with all those tasks; I was spending it all mindlessly on the internet. I didn't want to do complete the most important tasks.

The most crucial detail is that I was consistently staying up late at night, wasting time on the internet, sleeping only 6 hours every day. That made me feel sluggish for the entire day that followed. All my workouts and green vegetable juices in the morning were useless in this situation. 

### The Solution

Time wasn't the issue; I had figured it out by December. I decided to address the elephant in the room, sleep. To solve it, I decided to sleep at least 8 hours every night. 

Along with that, I decided to get my procrastination in check. Something had to change to get more work done and get rid of distractions. That's when Cal Newport's Deep Work and the ideas came back to my mind. I listened to a couple of podcasts, YouTube videos about other people trying this and finally settled on this schedule. I've been following this for the last ten days. 

5:00 AM - 5:30 AM - Get a shower, get ready, drink vegetable juice

5:30 AM - 9:00 AM - Deep Work

9:00 AM - 4:00 PM - Regular shallow work (jobs, chores, piano, guitar)

4:00 PM - 5:00 PM - Workout 

5:00 PM - 6:30 PM - Dinner

6:30 PM - 8:00 PM - Chill out and unwind

8:00 PM - SLEEP

I get the essential brain intensive work done right at the beginning of the day. These are things that are very good for my career and future that require intense focus. I'm trying to do them when distractions are minimum, and my mind is at peak clarity. Right now, deep work can be any of these: Thesis work, Coding Interview Questions, High Priority Books. 

During the deep work sessions, I construct the best environment possible to create laser-sharp focus. I start them with a 15 min meditation session (Tide App). No social media, no phone calls/emails and keeping digital usage to a minimum. For thesis work, I load all research papers on my iPad the day before, so the internet isn't needed. For Interview Questions, I have a physical book. For high priority books, I have them downloaded beforehand. So there's no excuse to use the internet here.

So far, I love this schedule. It was a pain trying to sleep at 8 PM for the first couple of days, but my body cooperated from the 4th day onwards.

Sleeping more has allowed me to thrive in all the jobs and hobbies I'm trying to do. Time was never the issue; the issue was always about getting enough rest, minimizing distractions and making space for the things that matter. Because I'm sleeping more, I can focus through the day and not feel like shit every morning after waking up. 

When people ask me if I can keep this schedule up, I point out that I've been working out regularly for years, playing the piano every day for months and generally have been good with keeping habits.
